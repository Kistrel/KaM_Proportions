I TOLD YOU NOT TO READ THIS! ><

Alright, if you insist on reading something read this: http://www.knightsandmerchants.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=2653


Still here?
Ok, some info:
-Project description: this is an helper tool for the mod Knights and Merchants Remake, which allows the players to check the game's data on buildings and units through an interactive Graphical User Interface. 

-Required compiler: I use Lazarus 1.2.6 ; don't know if other compilers would work.

-The link above also contains a compiled version of this tool.
